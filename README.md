Understanding Claude Chat
Claude Chat is your direct interface to Anthropic's Claude AI, customized for the crypto and Solana context. This isn't a generic chatbot with crypto keywords added — it's a thoughtfully configured AI companion that understands the unique needs of traders and builders.

WHAT CLAUDE KNOWS:
- Solana ecosystem fundamentals
- DeFi protocols and mechanics
- Trading strategies and risk management
- Token economics and tokenomics
- Community building and marketing
- Technical analysis concepts
- On-chain data interpretation

HOW CLAUDE THINKS:
Claude doesn't just pattern-match keywords. It genuinely reasons about your questions, considers context, and provides thoughtful responses. It will push back on bad ideas, acknowledge uncertainty, and admit when something is outside its expertise.

CLAUDE'S LIMITATIONS:
- No real-time market data access
- Cannot execute transactions
- Knowledge cutoff exists
- Cannot browse the internet live
- Not financial advice

Understanding these limitations helps you use Claude effectively. It's an analytical and creative partner, not an oracle or trading bot.

Effective Prompting
Get better results from Claude with these prompting strategies:

BE SPECIFIC
Instead of: "Tell me about Solana"
Try: "Explain how Solana's proof-of-history consensus mechanism improves transaction throughput compared to traditional proof-of-stake"

PROVIDE CONTEXT
Instead of: "Should I buy this token?"
Try: "I'm looking at a new memecoin that launched 2 hours ago. It has 500 holders, $200k liquidity, and the dev wallet holds 5%. What red flags should I look for?"

ASK FOR REASONING
Instead of: "Is this a good idea?"
Try: "Walk me through the pros and cons of providing liquidity to a new pool in the first 24 hours"

REQUEST FORMATS
"Give me a bullet-point list of..."
"Explain this like I'm new to crypto..."
"What are the three most important factors..."

ITERATE AND REFINE
Claude remembers your conversation. Build on previous responses:
"That's helpful. Now let's dive deeper into the second point..."
"What about edge cases where that wouldn't apply?"

CHALLENGE CLAUDE
"What am I missing here?"
"What would a critic say about this strategy?"
"What's the worst-case scenario?"
03
